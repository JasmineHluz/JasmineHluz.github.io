    <p> Domestic violence is a worldwide problem from over centuries. Although we as a society have grown, we still deal with this problem and no one tries to talk about how domestic violence can affect others. Don't turn a blind eye and don't ignore. Just because it is our family that is the attacker, we can't make excuses to save them. Speak up, don't be afraid. </p>
